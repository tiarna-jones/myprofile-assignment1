<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION:</h2>

<p>Born in 1990 in Tweed Heads Hospital, NSW, Australia, I have lived on the Gold Coast my whole life.
<br>I am the youngest of 3 girls, we are fairly close in age and growing up we were a very close family.
<br>My two sisters have always been my best friends. Between the 3 of us and our partners we have provided our parents with 13 Grandchildren. </p>

<h4>Sisters - Tiarna (youngest), Jessica (oldest)Jamie (middle)</h4>
<br></br>
<br></br>

<p>I attended Palm Beach Currumbin High School, where I immersed myself in the Sports Excellence Program paying basketball.
<br>I also played competitively outside of school with club basketball and Gold Coast basketball.
<br>I continued playing up until recently when I fractured my tibia, saving my daughters basketball from floating away in the creek at the back of our house.</p> 
<p>In year 11, I ended up leaving school so I could start to pursue a career in hospitality.</p>

<p>I have been happily married to my husband Justin since 2016 and have 2 beautiful children, my 4 year old daughter Memphys and my 1.5 year old son Mason.
<br>We are a very tall family, and my children tower over the other kids their age.</p>

<h2>INTERESTS IN IT</h1>
<p>I have decided to pursue IT, as my work requires me to be on the computer 100% of the working day. 
  <br>The main programs we use on our Mac are Firefox, Adobe photoshop, Adobe Bridge, notes and mail.
  <br>As there are numerous apps/ tabs open at the same time, we are always having technical issues with our computer, like lagging, computer freezing and randomly shutting down. 
  <br>Growing a wider knowledge on computer systems and learning how to navigate my way around and fix these issues, will highly benefit our business and help it progress and grow.

<p>I have always been fascinated by technology growing up, my mother introduced me to games on floppy discs 
  <br>such as Lemmings, Duke Nukem, The Secret of Monkey Island, The secret of the lost rainforest, Atlantis (mainly adventure puzzle games) when I was 3 
  <br>and I was constantly playing and evolving just as the games were. In my teen years my fascination turned into awe as the internet became prominent in all aspects of life. 
  <br>Now days it’s vital for day to day living and running of businesses. 

<p>I didn’t actually realise that IT is something that I want to go after for a career until recently, 
  <br>when I thought I may want a change from my current profession.</p>
I decided to take the Open Universities test after seeing it advertised on tv. 
<br>When I saw that the results were mainly focused on courses in IT, it just made sense, as its always been a hobby and there is so many possibilities in this field. 
<br>So I chose to start at the beginning with doing the course Introduction to Information Technology at RMIT. </p>

<p>I am still undecided what area i’m wanting to go into, but i’m hoping to eventually get my degree in IT and go from there.</p>

<h2>PROJECT IDEA</h2>
<h3>OVERVIEW -</h3>
<p>An application you will be able to download on your smartphone or tablet. 
<br>This app will be designed to introduce and keep you connected with book lovers around the word and locally. 
  <br>You will be able to discuss, rate, review and receive and offer suggestions of books that you have read, or are interested in reading.</p>

<h3>MOTIVATION -</h3> 
<p>My favourite past time is reading. It’s actually more like an obsession. I find that I am the only person in my social circle who enjoys it so much.
<br>When I have finished a book or a series that I have loved, disliked, or are very annoyed with the ending, 
  <br>the main thing that I want to do it to talk about it with someone who understands and has also loved, disliked or was very annoyed with the ending.
<br>As I don’t have that in reality, I usually log into facebook and head over to one of the many book pages/groups that I have joined. 
  <br>There I will write a post about the book I just finished, and if i’m lucky it will get a few comments or likes but as there are thousands of members in this group, 
  <br>my posts usually just get lost amongst all the other posts and I find that I can’t have a proper discussion about it. </p>

<p>I have noticed that I am not the only one who has had this happened too. 
  <br>There are people posting wanting to talk about books they have previously read, people looking for reading buddies 
  <br>(2 or more people to read the same book at the same time), looking for book recommendations based of books that they have read and liked 
  <br>or books others have read and liked and asking if people live in the same area as they do so they can meet like minded people and become friends or start book clubs. </p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION -</h3>

<p>This app will allow you to create your own custom profile, by choosing colours, language and layout. <br>
  <br>It will be clean looking and easy to use. You will be able to upload photos (personal or of books), input personal informations that you would like to share with other app users, <br>
  <br>meet and add new friends and be able to correspond via messages, comments and posts. <br>
You will be able to create book lists and select the description of these lists eg. genres, authors, love, DNF (did not finish) .<br> 
  <br>You will be able to mark the books in these lists as ‘Read’, ‘Want to Read”, “Currently Reading”, “Loved”, “Disliked”, “Re-read”. <br>
  <br>You will be able to enter the date you start a book and the date that you finish the book and also the device on which you read the book on eg. <br>
  <br>Kindle, audio book, paperback. You will be able to rate and review books by giving it a star rating out of 5, <br>
  <br>whether you would recommend it to others, rate the writing style, the story content and add photos. </p>

<p>There will be a search bar, so you would be able to search books and authors, or just browse through a vast variety of books. <br>
  <br>You will be able to receive notifications to let you know what’s been happening on your profile. <br>
  <br>There will be a news feed that will keep you up to date with your favourite books and authors and also keep you informed with what your friend have been up too. <br>
<br>There will be groups that you can create or join for the different genres of books or different authors/series ect. </p>

<p>On signing up to this app you will be asked questions about the type of books you are interested in, and also a wide variety of things in general to gauge your interests, <br>
  <br>likes, dislikes hobbies and personality. Based on your answers the app will recommend books to you (which you can then add to a to be read list) <br>
  <br>and also recommend people who you have similar interests with and you can choose to add them as a friend.</p><br>

<p>This app will have reading challenges(see next paragraph), book discussions, book recommendations, quizzes and games(see next paragraph), <br>
  <br>read alongs that you will be able to start at any time by yourself or with one or more users on the app. <br>
<br>If you opt in you will be notified of other book lovers that are in your area and you can decide if you want to message and add them as a friend. <br>
  <br>You could also choose if you would like to start a book club either virtually or in person. </p>
<br></br>
<p>Book Challenge examples-  daily, weekly, monthly and yearly challenges. </p>
<p>- A book that makes you laugh</p>
<p>- A book that makes you cry</p>
<p>- A book about books</p>
<p>- A book that inspires you to try something new</p>
<p>- A book set in a location that you would like to travel too</p>
<p>- A book that’s an award winning book</p>

<h4>Myer-Briggs Test</h4>

<h4>Learning Style Test</h4>

<h4>Big 5 Personality Test</h4>
<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?:</h3>
<p>These results mark me as a team player, and it means that I can work cohesively in a team environment.
It also shows me that I can work independently. 
Im a visual learner which is accurate, over the years when I was learning things for the first time, all someone had to do was show me once and I picked it up.</p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?: </h3>
<p>These results just confirm that I will be able to work easily and happily in a team environment, and I would be an asset as It would go against my nature to deliberately disappoint my team members. </p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?:  </h3>
<p>As I feel more comfortable being deligated tasks, I would need to ensure that my team has a good strong leader, that knows the aspects of the tasks that our group would need to accomplish.
I should also find a team that is happy to show me the ropes when I don’t understand a concept. 
<p>
